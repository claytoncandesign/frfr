    <p>to encode this simple website it takes two different coding styles.  The syntax for each being very different.  But alas without any interaction with the viewer, it makes writing this site far easier.  Without javascript one uses html to code blocks of text and headers.  You can organize things using classes and id's but for style you need to learn CSS. The CSS then manipulates the html and makes it look good, or as good as a designer as the programmer is.  So i am going to cede the rest of this paragraph to text copied directly from a random wikipedia article: <br>Edwin F. Sweet was born in Dansville, New York. He was the son of Sidney Sweet and Hannah (n√©e Redmond) Sweet.[1] He attended the common schools and Dansville Seminary. He graduated from the literary department of Yale College in 1871, where he was a member of Skull and Bones. He was a brother of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Phi chapter).[2]:15<br>After graduation, Sweet engaged in a tour of Europe and the Holy Land. Departing from New York city October 9, 1871, he went to Liverpool, Wales, London, Paris, Marseilles, Rome, Naples, and Brindisi. He then sailed to Alexandria, Egypt, went up the River Nile to the first Cataract, and then spent a month in Palestine. On his return, he passed through Syria, Constantinople, Athens, Venice, Switzerland, Austria, Prussia, Sweden, and Scotland. He returned to New York City one year to the day after his departure. In January 1873, he entered the law department of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and graduated in 1874.</p>
